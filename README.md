Resources Used for Assistance:
I looked at the code of another repo for assistance upon encountering trouble with setting up my code. My html lines 56-88 were helped by comparing them to the html code of the following repo:
https://github.com/jdlawton/portfolio/blob/master/index.html (html lines 66-103)

I also referenced the css code of another repo when having trouble with the layout of the main body. My css code lines  131-142 are copied from another repo, found here:
[https://github.com/JaspreetKhela/Module-2-Weekly-Challenge-Advanced-CSS-Challenge-Professional-Portfolio/blob/main/assets/css/styles.css ](https://github.com/jdlawton/portfolio/blob/master/assets/css/style.css)(css lines 163-172)

The responsive sizing coding was written after looking at the code here:
https://github.com/jdlawton/portfolio/blob/master/assets/css/style.css (css lines 305-351)
